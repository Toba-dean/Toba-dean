### Hi there, I am Toba 👋

<h3 align="center">A passionate frontend developer from Nigeria, I enjoy using responsive design ideas and seeing how my web pages shrink and still look great on mobile devices. It's strangely gratifying. In some ways, I think I'm like those web pages; I'm malleable, yet I still have my creative flair.</h3>

- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything 🤣
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate with other content creators
- 🥅 2022 Goals: Contribute more to Open Source projects
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love to listen to cool music and addicted to coding.
