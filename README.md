### Hi there, I am Toba ğŸ‘‹

## A self-taught frontend developer with an interest in cutting-edge technologies and interactive design. 
I enjoy using responsive design ideas and seeing how my web pages shrink and still look great on mobile devices. It's strangely gratifying. 
In some ways, I think I'm like those web pages; I'm malleable, yet I still have my creative flair.

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning everything ğŸ¤£
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with other content creators
- ğŸ¥… 2022 Goals: Contribute more to Open Source projects
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love to listen to cool music and addicted to coding.
